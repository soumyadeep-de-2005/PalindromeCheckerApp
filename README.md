Objective of the Project

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a program that checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome or not.

This project helps to:

Understand string manipulation

Practice conditional statements and loops

Learn basic input and output operations

Improve problem-solving skills using programming logic

🔁 Flow of the Project

Start the program

Accept input from the user (string or number)

Reverse the input value

Compare the original input with the reversed value

If both are equal, display “Palindrome”

Otherwise, display “Not a Palindrome”

End the program

🛠️ Project Procedure  

First, I created a program that takes input from the user (word or number).

The input is stored in a variable.

I then reversed the input using logic (loop or built-in method).

The reversed value is stored in another variable.

The original value and reversed value are compared.

If both values are the same, the program prints that the given input is a palindrome.

If they are not the same, the program prints that it is not a palindrome.

The program then terminates after displaying the result.

👤 Use Case of the Project
Use Case: Check Palindrome

Actor: User

Description:
The user enters a word or number. The system checks whether it is a palindrome and displays the result.

Steps:

User enters input (string or number)

System reverses the input

System compares original and reversed values

System displays result:

“It is a Palindrome”

OR “It is Not a Palindrome”
